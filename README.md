### Yo! What's up! 👋

My name is Kevin, I'm a Web developer currently working on [MonClubSportif](https://monclubsportif.com/) for the lovely [Leonard Web Agency](https://leonardagenceweb.com/en/).

I mostly work with Ruby on Rails & Nuxt.js right now, but I'm always looking for new cool tech to try!

You can check me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-metivier/) too!

Cya! 🍻
